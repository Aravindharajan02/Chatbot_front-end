# Chatbot_front-end
This code makes a webpage that shows three cat animations: one of a cat walking, one of a cat in a box, and one of a cat popping up. 
The animations play in a loop, with each animation appearing for a few seconds before the next one starts. 
This Chatbot front-end is working only with the 3 gif.The gif appearence time is changed so it looks they are connected together.
Note: I cant find any similar gif so thats why i use different gif. It may seems not related to each other.
kindly check it out.
